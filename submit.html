        <p>Mzamomtsha Primary School is located between Khayelistha Township and Umfuleni Township in the Western Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. <br> The schools headmaster, Mr. Simphiwe Khuze, joined in 2007. The school is located in a semi-township
            called Drift Sands which started off as an informal settlement. <br> Drift Sands has since been developed and with support from the South African government it turned into a sprawling township with state of the art housing units.<br> Mzamomtsha
            Primary School is plays a key role in Drift Sands and is supporting the local community. The school was initially created for primary school students from grade 1 to grade 7,
            <br>but due to the rapid population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades.<br> Students are allowed up to grade 12 - which is the metric year.</p>
